Assignment from TOP Ruby Course

Here we will create a Mastermind game, using Ruby and the console.

The game consists in guessing a combination of 4 colors, from a total of six. A player (or computer) decides a combination of 4 colors, and the other player must guess the combination
For each guess, hints are provided, in form of up to 4 circles with different colors, if the color picked is correct and in the correct position (white color) or if the color picked is correct but in the wrong position. No details on which of the colors are provided.

The guessing player have 8 turns to successfully guess the code
